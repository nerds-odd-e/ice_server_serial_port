======================================================================
Requirements
======================================================================


Windows version
---------------

Ice has been extensively tested with Windows XP. A Ice binary
distribution for Borland is available from:

  http://www.zeroc.com/download.html

These binary distributions include everything necessary to build Ice 
applications and require Windows XP.


C++ compiler
------------

Ice supports Borland C++Builder 2006 Update 2.

NMAKE
-----

In order to build Ice you need nmake, MicroSoft's make utility, 
installed. If you do not already have it installed, you can download it
from the following link.

Third-party libraries
---------------------

Ice has dependencies on a number of third-party libraries:

- Berkeley DB 4.3.29
- expat 1.9x
- OpenSSL 0.9.7 or later (OpenSSL 0.9.8 or later recommended)
- bzip2 1.0

If you have downloaded an Ice binary installer, you already have all 
of the required third-party libraries and do not need to download any 
additional packages, nor do you need to compile the Ice source
code.

You can download an installer containing binaries for all of the 
required third-party libraries from the ZeroC web site:

  http://www.zeroc.com/download.html

Python
------

You will need Python to run the automated test suite. If you have no
interest in running the test scripts, Python is not required.

You can download a Python distribution for Windows from
http://www.python.org/download

Important note for Windows 98, Windows 98 SE and Windows ME users:

The Windows 9x shell is too limited to run the Ice test suite. For
these versions of Windows, you need Cygwin and the python interpreter
that comes with Cygwin in order to run the test suite. Cygwin can be
downloaded from:

http://www.cygwin.com


======================================================================
Compilation and Testing
======================================================================

Using your favorite Zip tool, unzip the Ice and Ice third-party 
archives anywhere you like.

Add the third-party libraries bin directory to your PATH.

Open a command prompt and change the working directory to Ice-3.1.1.
For example:

$ cd C:\Ice-3.1.1

Edit config/Make.rules to establish your build configuration. The
comments in the file provide more information. Pay particular
attention to the variable that define the locations of the third-
party libraries.

Now you're ready to build Ice:

$ nmake /f Makefile.mak

You can now run the test suite, provided that you have installed 
Python. Open a command prompt and change to the top- level Ice 
directory. At the command prompt, execute:

  python allTests.py

If everything worked out, you should see lots of "ok" messages. In
case of a failure, the tests abort with "failed".

If you want to try out any of the demos, make sure to update your PATH
environment variable to add the "bin" directory, which contains the
Ice DLLs and executables.


======================================================================
Windows 98, Windows 98 SE, Windows ME, Windows NT 3.51 
======================================================================

By default, IceUtil::Mutex and related classes are implemented using
Windows' CriticalSection, and in particular they use the function
TryEnterCriticalSection. This function is either not present or
implemented as a "no-op" call on Windows 98, Windows 98 SE, Windows ME
and Windows NT 3.51, so default Ice builds cannot be used on these
versions of Windows.

IceUtil::Mutex and related classes can also use "heavier" mutex
objects that allow Ice to work on all Windows versions (>= 98). If you
wish to build Ice in this configuration, you must first edit the file
include\IceUtil\Config.h and remove the following lines:

#   ifndef _WIN32_WINNT
        //
        // Necessary for TryEnterCriticalSection.
        //
#       define _WIN32_WINNT 0x0400
#   endif

The IceGrid Node is not available on Windows 98, 98SE and ME, because
it requires a DLL that is not available on these versions of Windows.

On Windows 98, Windows 98 SE and Windows ME, we also recommend that
you increase the number of connections supported by TCP/IP (to 500 for
example). See MaxConnections at
http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;158474


======================================================================
Installation
======================================================================

Simply run "nmake /f Makefile.mak install". This will install Ice in
the directory specified by the "prefix" variable in
config/Make.rules.mak. After installation, make sure that the
<prefix>/bin directory is in your PATH.
