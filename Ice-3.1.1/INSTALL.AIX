Requirements
======================================================================


Operating System
----------------

AIX 5.2 on Power or PowerPC


C++ compiler
------------

VisualAge C++ 6.0 with the April 2004 PTF


C compiler
----------

IBM xlc


Third-party libraries
---------------------

Ice has dependencies on a number of third-party libraries:

- Berkeley DB 4.3.29 with C++ support enabled, and built with a C++
  compiler compatible with the one you are using.

  You can download the Berkeley DB source distribution from
  http://www.sleepycat.com/download

  We recommend that you configure and build Berkeley DB like this:

  $ ../dist/configure --enable-cxx --enable-posixmutexes
  (plus --prefix=<dir> and/or --enable-java if you like)
  $ gmake

  If you intend to use Ice for Java with Berkeley DB, you must also
  include the option --enable-java.

  For 64 bit builds, use this configuration:

  $ export OBJECT_MODE=64
  $ ../dist/configure --enable-cxx --enable-posixmutexes
  (plus --prefix=<dir> and/or --enable-java if you like)
  $ gmake

- OpenSSL

  For 32 bit builds, we recommend openssl-0.9.7g-1 from the "AIX
  Toolbox for Linux Applications" (cryptographic section):
  http://www.ibm.com/servers/aix/products/aixos/linux/ezinstall.html

  For 64 bit builds, we recommend using OpenSSL 0.9.8b (or later).
  You can download the source distribution from
  http://www.openssl.org.

- expat 1.9x, which can be downloaded from
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/expat

  You can also use the binary distribution for AIX 5.1 available in
  the "AIX Toolbox for Linux Applications":

  http://www.ibm.com/servers/aix/products/aixos/linux/ezinstall.html

- bzip2 1.0

  The source distribution can be downloaded from
  http://sources.redhat.com/bzip2

  For 32 bit builds, you can also use the binary distribution from the
  "AIX Toolbox for Linux Applications".


GNU Make 3.80
-------------

GNU Make 3.80 is required to build Ice on AIX. You can download GNU
Make from the "AIX Toolbox for Linux Applications".


Python
------

You will need Python to run the automated test suite. If you have no
interest in running the test scripts, Python is not required.

You can download Python from the "AIX Toolbox for Linux Applications".


======================================================================
Compilation and Testing
======================================================================

Extract the Ice archive in any directory you like (for example, in
your home directory):

$ gunzip -c Ice-3.1.1.tar.gz | tar xvf -

Change the working directory to Ice-3.1.1:

$ cd Ice-3.1.1

Edit config/Make.rules to establish your build configuration. The
comments in the file provide more information. Pay particular
attention to the variables that define the locations of the third-
party libraries.

Now you're ready to build Ice:

$ gmake

This will build the Ice core libraries, services, tests and examples.
After a successful build, you can run the test suite, provided that
you have installed Python:

$ gmake test

This is equivalent to:

$ python allTests.py

If everything worked out, you should see lots of "ok" messages. In
case of a failure, the tests abort with "failed".

If you want to try out any of the demos, make sure to update your PATH
environment variable to add the "bin" directory, and your LIBPATH
environment variable to add the "lib" directory:

$ export PATH=`pwd`/bin:$PATH
$ export LIBPATH=`pwd`/lib:$LIBPATH


======================================================================
Library versioning
======================================================================

Ice uses the same library versioning convention as the packages
distributed in the "AIX Toolbox for Linux Applications". See the link
below for more information:

http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=10892444


======================================================================
64 bit builds
======================================================================

To build Ice in 64-bit mode, you need to do the following:

- Obtain or build all the third-party dependencies in 64-bit mode. A
  number of packages from the "AIX Toolbox for Linux Applications"
  provide both 32 and 64 bit shared objects in the same archive
  libraries.

  For example:

  $ ar -t -X32_64 /opt/freeware/lib/libexpat.a
  libexpat.so.0
  libexpat.so.0

- Set the environment variable OBJECT_MODE to 64, as shown below:

  $ export OBJECT_MODE=64

- Build and test as described above.


======================================================================
Installation
======================================================================

Simply run "gmake install". This will install Ice in the directory
specified by the "prefix" variable in config/Make.rules.

After installation, make sure that the <prefix>/bin directory is in
your PATH, and the <prefix>/lib directory is in your LIBPATH. When
compiling Ice programs, you must pass the location of the
<prefix>/include directory to the compiler with the -I option, and the
location of the <prefix>/lib directory with the -L option.
