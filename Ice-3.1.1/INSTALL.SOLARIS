======================================================================
Requirements
======================================================================


Operating System
----------------

Ice is expected to build and run properly on Solaris 8, Solaris 9
and Solaris 10 on SPARC and Intel/AMD64. 
However, Ice is officially supported only on Solaris 9 on SPARC.

You also need to have /dev/urandom installed. This is installed by
default on Solaris 9 and Solaris 10; on Solaris 8, you need to install 
patch 112438-01.


C++ compiler
------------

The following Sun compilers are supported:

- Sun C++ 5.5 (part of Sun ONE Studio 8.0)

- Sun C++ 5.8 (part of Sun Studio 11)

Builds with the following compilers are expected to succeed, but these
compilers are not supported at this time:

- Sun C++ 5.6 and 5.7 (Sun Studio 9 and Sun Studio 10 respectively)

- GCC 3.4.2


Third-party libraries
---------------------

Ice has dependencies on a number of third-party libraries:

- Berkeley DB 4.3.29 configured with --enable-cxx, and built with a
  C++ compiler compatible with the one you are using.

  If you intend to use Ice for Java with Berkeley DB, you must also
  include the option --enable-java.

- expat 1.9x

- OpenSSL 0.9.7 or later (OpenSSL 0.9.8 or later recommended)

- bzip2 1.0

You can download these packages at the following locations:

Berkeley DB    http://www.sleepycat.com/download
expat          http://sourceforge.net/projects/expat/
OpenSSL        http://www.openssl.org
bzip2          http://sources.redhat.com/bzip2

bzip2 comes with Solaris, in Sun package SUNWbzip (32 bit) and
SUNWbzipx (64 bit). You may want to apply patch 114586-01 to get the
latest bzip2 version, 1.0.2.

Some packages are also available at http://www.sunfreeware.com.


GNU Make 3.80
-------------

GNU Make 3.80 is required to build Ice on SPARC/Solaris. You can
download GNU Make from http://www.sunfreeware.com.


Python
------

You will need Python to run the automated test suite. If you have no
interest in running the test scripts, Python is not required.

You can download Python from http://www.sunfreeware.com.


======================================================================
Compilation and Testing
======================================================================

Extract the Ice archive in any directory you like (for example, in
your home directory):

$ tar xvfz Ice-3.1.1.tar.gz

Change the working directory to Ice-3.1.1:

$ cd Ice-3.1.1

Edit config/Make.rules to establish your build configuration. The
comments in the file provide more information. Pay particular
attention to the variables that define the locations of the third-
party libraries.

If you want to build with g++ instead of Sun CC, edit the file
config/Make.rules.SunOS and change or comment out the CXX = <compiler>
line (at the top of the file). The default value for CXX with GNU make
is g++.

Now you're ready to build Ice:

$ gmake

This will build the Ice core libraries, services, tests and examples.
After a successful build, you can run the test suite, provided that
you have installed Python:

$ gmake test

This is equivalent to:

$ python allTests.py

If everything worked out, you should see lots of "ok" messages. In
case of a failure, the tests abort with "failed".

If you want to try out any of the demos, make sure to update your PATH
environment variable to add the "bin" directory, and your
LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to add the "lib" directory.  For
64 bit builds, add "lib" to LD_LIBRARY_PATH_64:

$ export PATH=`pwd`/bin:$PATH
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd`/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH_64=`pwd`/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH_64


======================================================================
64 bit builds
======================================================================

To build Ice in 64 bit mode, you need to do the following:

- Obtain or build all the third-party dependencies, and put the 64 bit
  libraries in the "lib/sparcv9" directories. For example, put
  Berkeley DB 64 bit libraries in $DB_HOME/lib/sparcv9.

- Set the environment variable LP64 to yes, as shown below:

  $ export LP64=yes

- Build and test as described above.


======================================================================
Installation
======================================================================

Simply run "gmake install". This will install Ice in the directory
specified by the "prefix" variable in config/Make.rules.

After installation, make sure that the <prefix>/bin directory is in
your PATH, and the <prefix>/lib directory is in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
When compiling Ice programs, you must pass the location of the
<prefix>/include directory to the compiler with the -I option, and the
location of the <prefix>/lib directory with the -L option.

If you built in 64 bit mode, the libraries are installed in
<prefix>/lib/sparcv9. No other changes are necessary.
